Hello, I am Steven Ngandeu Schepanski, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Charité Competence Center for Traditional and Integrative Medicine (CCCTIM), led by Prof. Georg Seifert at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. My research lies at the intersection of mental health, immunology, and early childhood development, with a particular focus on how early attachment experiences and unresolved emotions influence these processes. Currently, I am investigating the efficacy of mind-body interventions in improving overall health in pregnant women and, consequently, their children.

I completed my PhD at the Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf in 2020, working in the labs of [Prof. Petra Arck](https://www.arcklab.de) and [Prof. Ileana Hanganu-Opatz](http://www.opatzlab.com). As a doctoral researcher, I explored the role of maternal microchimerism and prenatal stress in perinatal brain development and cognition. My academic background is in psychology, with a specialization in clinical psychology and psychobiology, and I have additional training in molecular biology.
